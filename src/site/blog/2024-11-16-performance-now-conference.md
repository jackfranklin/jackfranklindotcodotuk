As I write this blog post I am sat in an AirBnB in Utrecht reflecting on two
incredibly inspiring days at [performance.now() 2024](https://perfnow.nl/). I
was not only fortunate to attend but to be asked to talk, and it was a real
privilege to get the chance to update the attendees on all our recent work
updating the performance panel with a myriad of new features.

Being present at this conference is an energy boost; a reminder that I am very
fortunate to work on a tool that many people use on a daily basis to help them
get their work done. It is an absolute privilege to be the person responsible
for the (mostly technical) direction of the performance tools in DevTools and
the desire to continue working to improve further is only heightened by spending
time with our users face to face.

A huge **thank you** to everyone who attended and who spoke to me or other
Googlers with their feedback - both the good and the bad - on what we can do
better. I joined Google and the DevTools team because I'd spent ten years using
the DevTools daily through from university to my first few tech jobs and even
after nearly five years the motivation to keep improving our tools so that
everyone can improve their effectiveness is very strong. If you didn't get a
chance to speak to us face to face, you can always
[file a bug or feature request](https://crbug.com/new) to bring it to our
attention. I promise that a human (most likely me!) reads all the performance
tooling related submissions we get.

If you are interested in performance on the web, I can't recommend
performance.now() enough. I have realised that hyper-focused conferences are the
most impactful and this is a great example. You don't have to familiar with
performance either; the community is encouraging, friendly and wants to welcome
folks in and help them gain the expertise to level up the web for everyone.

If you'd like a deeper summary of all the talks,

is a fantastic read.
